Now that you have Showcase 2012 installed and activated, you might be wondering what you can do with it. Showcase 2012 is a powerful tool that can help you create stunning 3D presentations of your designs, with realistic materials, lighting, and environments. Here are some of the features that Showcase 2012 offers:

- Enhanced Interactive Ray-Tracing: With RapidRT ray-tracing functionality, you can switch on the fly between a GPU-powered viewport and full Ray-Tracing, without the need to change materials, lighting, or environments. The RapidRT Ray-Tracing engine renders the scene progressively, directly in the viewport. With Showcase 2012, RapidRT Ray-Tracing has been accelerated by a factor of up to 10x[^1^].
- Enhanced Interoperability: Showcase 2012 supports Autodesk Materials, featuring hundreds of real-world materials. These can be automatically imported from Autodesk Inventor (IPT/IAM), AutoCAD (DWG file format), Autodesk Revit (Autodesk FBX asset exchange technology), and Autodesk 3ds Max Design (FBX) software. They can also be fine-tuned by tweaking real-world material properties: glossy or matte paint[^1^].

Showcase 2012 also supports Autodesk Inventor constraints, which can be transformed into Showcase behaviors (only a single Constraint per Inventor file is supported), and the new Import Templates, which automatically create a Showcase scene from an Inventor file, complete with Materials, Shots, Alternatives, Behaviors, and Slides[^1^].

Additionally, the interoperability with Autodesk Maya and 3ds Max Design through FBX has also been improved and now includes support for cameras[^1^].
- Real-time geometry-on-geometry shadows and Automatic Ambient Shadows: Create highly realistic imagery by automatically simulating Ambient Shadows for polygonal objects, and adding real-time geometry-casted shadows[^1^].
- Simple Object Placement: It is now easier to aggregate objects in the scene, such as placing objects on a kitchen counter. The Simple Object Placement enables you to snap objects to other geometry in the scene[^1^].
- NPR Effects and Styles User Interface: Create a variety of non-photorealistic (NPR) effects that help simulate artistic styles created by hand. The Styles User Interface aggregates all rendering styles in one view, making it quicker and easier to explore options[^1^].
- Smart walkthroughs and 3Dconnexion support: Use the Autodesk SteeringWheel Walk functionality to walk naturally around architectural scenes. Navigate up or down stairs, or remain on the ground level; avoid walls and other obstacles. Showcase 2012 also supports 3Dconnexion input devices for motion control[^1^].
- Quick Start Wizards: Users who are new to Showcase can now be productive almost immediately. The new Quick Start Wizards guide users through common workflows in 2-6 steps, accelerating time to completion, and allowing for a successful finish[^1^].

With these features and more, Showcase 2012 can help you create impressive 3D presentations that showcase your designs in the best possible light. To learn more about Showcase 2012, you can watch this video tutorial[^2^] or visit the official website[^3^].
